Welcome on the KMF source code repository :-)

Kevoree (see [http://www.kevoree.org](http://www.kevoree.org)) is a full Models@Runtime environment to create, manipulate and deploy component-based systems.
Therefore, the efficiency of the code used to deal with models is crutial.

Facing some difficulties in using the code generated by EMF in Kevoree,
we decided to develop a solution more suitable for our concerns.

Basically, the Kevoree Modeling Framework takes a Ecore Meta-model as input, and generates the code, loader, serializer and cloner,
 to enable the manipulation of models compliant to this meta-model.

The best way to get more information about what is generated, and how to use it is probably to use it on one of your existing Meta-model.
See our org.kevoree.modeling.emf.scala.gencode.sample project to generate code for your ecore File. You can also refer to [this page](https://github.com/dukeboard/kevoree-modeling-framework/wiki/Getting-started) to create your own project.


N.B.: This project is still under maturation and not all EMF features have been implemented yet.
Should you face any difficulties or experiemnt any problem, please feel free to raise an issue.

KMF implementation has been submitted to the Models'2012 conference : [KMF paper'2012](http://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/docs/00/71/45/58/PDF/emfatruntime.pdf).

KMF2 version include a lot of improvement since the presentation of this paper :

In addition to performance speedup we introduce the KMFQL langage, documentation can be found at the following address : [KMFQL documentation](https://github.com/dukeboard/kevoree-modeling-framework/blob/master/doc/kmf_path.md)
